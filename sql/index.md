# SQL Access

Home Assistant has an internal SQL database front-ended by the [Recorder](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/) integration. It holds, history, activity, long term statistics and more. Underneath it can by Sqlite (most common), MariaDB, MySQL or PostgreSQL.

When in `live` mode, the `ha-repl` exposes an `sql` variable, which allows access to this database, via the Recorder interface.

`sql` and its results are local objects. A query is sent to Home Assistant, the rows come back as one download, and everything after that - `show()`, slicing, dataframes, CSV export - works on that local copy, with whatever libraries you have installed locally. Nothing extra needs installing in Home Assistant.

Info

Data is serialized as Apache Arrow using the `nanofeather` library - this provides column-oriented data for good compression, zero-copy reuse into dataframes and good compatibility with popular data libraries like `polars` and `pandas`.

### `sql` Object

| Operation                          | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sql("<query>")`                   | Send a query to the database and wait for results                                                                                            |
| `sql("<query>", legacy=True)`      | The same, with [legacy columns](#legacy-columns) in view                                                                                     |
| `sql.max_rows`                     | Read/write property to set the default row limit for results in this session                                                                 |
| `sql.table("<name>")`              | Returns the `Table` object that describes the named table and its contents, or raises `KeyError` if there is no such table                   |
| `sql.table("<name>", legacy=True)` | The same, with the table's [legacy columns](#legacy-columns) included                                                                        |
| `sql.tables`                       | Returns a list of `Table` objects that describe each table and its contents, with a `VirtualTable` for each [virtual table](#virtual-tables) |

For example this will show the size of the `statistics` table.

```python
>>> results=sql('select * from event_types')
>>> sql('select count(*) from statistics').show()
```

### Result Objects

On the result object, `show()` will display data in tabular form at the command, using the `rich` library's table support.

The result will have its rows automatically limited, so it doesn't lock up the console - use `max_rows` to override this. The columns shown are the same ones a row of the result has, so `show()` and `[0]` always agree; use `max_cols` to cap how many, or `columns` to set the list of columns specifically.

A single row can be picked out by position, so `[0]` for the first row or `[-1]` for the last - see [Row Objects](#row-objects). The results can also be sliced like a Python list, so `[:10]` for the first 10 rows or `[-10:]` for the last 10. Slices share the downloaded data rather than copying it. For anything more advanced - a step, filtering, sorting, joins - turn the result into a dataframe with `to_polars()`, which also uses the downloaded Arrow data directly. You can also call `len()` on the results to get the number of rows.

### Row Objects

Indexing a result with a row number gives a `Row` object. It reads like a list of the row's values, in column order, and can also be indexed by column name.

| Operation      | Description                                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `values`       | List of the values in the row, in column order                               |
| `column_names` | List of the column names, in the same order                                  |
| `table`        | The `Table` object of the result the row came from, or `None` if it had none |
| `to_dict()`    | The row as a `dict` of column name to value                                  |

```python
>>> sql("select count(*) from events")[0][0]
>>> row = sql("select * from states_meta")[0]
>>> row["entity_id"]
>>> {col: sql(f"select count(distinct {col}) from events")[0][0] for col in sql.table("events").column_names}
```

### Table Objects

A `Table` object describes one table, using Home Assistant's own definition of it in `homeassistant.components.recorder.db_schema`.

| Operation      | Description                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`         | The table's name in the database, e.g. `states`                                                                             |
| `class_name`   | The name of the class the Recorder uses for this table, e.g. `States`, to look up in `db_schema`. Empty for a virtual table |
| `description`  | That class's docstring, e.g. `State change history.`                                                                        |
| `columns`      | List of `Column` objects, each with a `name`, `type` and `legacy` flag                                                      |
| `column_names` | List of the column names, in order                                                                                          |
| `virtual`      | `True` if this is a [virtual table](#virtual-tables) rather than a real table in the database                               |

Both leave out the [legacy columns](#legacy-columns), unless the table came from `sql.table("<name>", legacy=True)`.

### Virtual Tables

A virtual table is a ready-made join, to query as if it were a table. It saves writing out a join that almost every query on that table needs, because the Recorder keeps the name of a thing - an entity id, an event type, a statistic id - in a different table from its rows.

Each virtual table has that name as its first column, then the columns of its table that are in use, without the [legacy columns](#legacy-columns) or the key the two tables are joined on.

| Virtual table                   | What it holds                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `state_history`                 | One row per recorded state, with its `entity_id`: `states` joined to `states_meta`                                  |
| `event_history`                 | One row per recorded event, with its `event_type`: `events` joined to `event_types`                                 |
| `statistics_history`            | One row an hour per long term statistic, with its `statistic_id`: `statistics` joined to `statistics_meta`          |
| `statistics_short_term_history` | One row every 5 minutes per statistic, with its `statistic_id`: `statistics_short_term` joined to `statistics_meta` |

```python
>>> sql("select * from state_history where entity_id = 'sensor.outside_temperature'").show()
>>> sql("select entity_id, count(*) from state_history group by entity_id").show()
>>> sql("select event_type, count(*) from event_history group by event_type").show()
>>> sql("select start_ts, mean from statistics_history where statistic_id = 'sensor.outside_temperature'").show()
>>> sql.table("state_history").column_names
```

A virtual table can be used wherever a real one can in a query - filtered, grouped, joined to other tables, real or virtual, or to itself - and the database does all of that work, as it would for the join written out.

`sql.tables` lists them among the real tables. Each is a `VirtualTable` object, which shows as `VirtualTable(...)` rather than `Table(...)`, so the two can't be mistaken for each other. It has everything a `Table` has, with `virtual` set to `True`, an empty `class_name`, and one thing more:

| Operation    | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `definition` | The query the virtual table stands for |

```python
>>> [t.name for t in sql.tables if t.virtual]
>>> sql.table("state_history").definition
```

Info

Nothing is created in the Home Assistant database. When a query mentions a virtual table by name, its definition is added to the query as a common table expression (a `with` clause) before it is run. If the query has a `with` clause of its own, the definition joins that one.

### Legacy Columns

Some Recorder tables still have columns that Home Assistant no longer writes to, because the data moved elsewhere - `entity_id` in `states`, for example, is now in `states_meta`. Home Assistant marks these in `db_schema` as `UNUSED_LEGACY_COLUMN`, and they are empty for anything recorded recently.

They are kept out of view by default, both in a `Table` and in a query's result. A query still downloads them, but the result leaves them out of everything it does - `show()`, rows, `column_names`, dataframes, exports - so `select * from states` shows only the columns in use.

A legacy column is in view when:

- the query names it
- the query is made with `legacy=True`
- `legacy` is set to `True` on the result afterwards, which needs no new query

```python
>>> r = sql("select * from states")                 # columns in use
>>> r.legacy = True                                 # now every column
>>> sql("select * from states", legacy=True)        # every column from the start
>>> sql("select state_id, entity_id from states")   # named, so in view
>>> sql.table("states").column_names               # columns in use
>>> sql.table("states", legacy=True).column_names  # every column
```

A query is checked by its words rather than parsed, so a legacy column mentioned anywhere in it, such as in a `where`, is in view.

### More Help

Use `help(sql)`, or call `help(..)` on a result, row or table object, to get reminded of the API. It gives a short summary of the methods, properties and attributes; add `full=True` for Python's own full help page.
