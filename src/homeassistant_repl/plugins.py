"""Plugins: plain Python run at the start of a session, as though
typed at the prompt - one top-level statement at a time, so in live mode
each goes to whichever side it belongs on (see repl.py's LiveSession).

Unlike the prompt, nothing is echoed, and a statement that fails is only a
warning: the rest of the file and the remaining files still run, so a
session always starts. Both the warnings and anything a file prints go to
stderr, leaving stdout to what `ha-repl exec` was actually asked for.

A file can tell where it's running from `MODE` and `SERVER` (see
bind_context), so one file can serve the live shell, exec and API client mode alike.
