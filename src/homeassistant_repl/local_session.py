"""API client mode's exec engine: runs snippets right here in the CLI
process, not on a remote Home Assistant session - there's no server to send
code to, since API client mode talks to Home Assistant only through its
standard API (see api_objtree.py). Deliberately mirrors
custom_components/ha_repl_server/session.py's exec model (top-level await,
trailing-expression echo) rather than importing it:
that module lives in a separate HACS-deployed package with its own packaging
boundary, and duplicating ~100 lines here is simpler than bridging it.

Simpler than session.py in one respect: output goes straight to the real
terminal, so there's no print()/help() capturing-and-shipping-back machinery,
and rich's Console can auto-detect color/width instead of being told.
