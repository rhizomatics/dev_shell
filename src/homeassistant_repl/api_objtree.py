"""ApiObjTree - API client mode's read-only `obj[...]`, built entirely from
Home Assistant's standard websocket API (get_states, config/*_registry/list)
- no ha_repl_server component needed, works against any instance an admin
token can reach. Bound to the same name, `obj`, as the live tree (see
apirepl.py) so a snippet that only touches `obj` runs unchanged in either
mode. Entities only have what that API exposes: state + attributes from
get_states, and whatever the entity registry's own partial dict exposes (no
live component instance, so no calling methods on it, no fields an
integration keeps off the registry/state).

Mirrors custom_components/ha_repl_server/objtree.py's shape - __getitem__,
.keys()/.values()/.items(), find(), show() all behave the same way modulo the
smaller attribute set - but lives in this package rather than that one (a
HACS-deployed component with its own packaging boundary), so the handful of
small, stable, HA-import-free pieces it needs (the ordered-view mixin,
parse_path, the None/empty-collection cleanup) are duplicated here rather than
imported across that boundary. Revisit if API client mode sticks and a shared
package becomes worth the packaging work.

Unlike the live tree, this one is explicitly a *snapshot*: fetching is async
(it's a websocket call) but Mapping's `__getitem__`/`__iter__`/`__len__` are
not, so refreshing can't happen lazily on access without risking asyncio
reentrancy (this is normally used from inside an already-running event loop).
Instead the owning REPL loop decides when to call `await cache.refresh()`
(e.g. between prompts, when `cache.is_stale()`) - see apirepl.py. `reset_cache()`
just marks the cache stale; it does not fetch.
